# Zendesk-Coding-Challenge

This project was conducted for the Zendesk 2019 coding challenge for the opportuniuty to engage in a six month internship within the Zendesk Melbourne office. The challenge required participants to build a feature that can make http requests to the Zendesk API, then display the tickets in either a GUI or CLI.

*__Internship offer received and accetped.__*

## Challenge Requirements

- Connect to the Zendesk API.
- Request the tickets for your account.
- Page through tickets when more than 25 are returned.
- Display tickets in a list.
- Display individual ticket details.
- Happy path tests provided (minimum).

A goal set by my team lead during my internship program was to see if I could iterate over my origin design using new skills learnt throughout the course of my internship. Bellow you will find the list of the current iterations I have completed or am currently working on.

| Project | Interface | Languages | Progress |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Version 1](./v1/) | CLI | JS, NodeJS| Complete |
| [Version 2](./v2/) | GUI | Scala | Complete |

## Update - February 2020
Unfortunately, the testing account associated with my internship was eventually disabled. So, as a replacement I have implemented my own [API](https://github.com/aronesusau/internship-api-mock) that will be able to provide the relevant mock data.
